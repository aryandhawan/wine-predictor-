# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction with Deep Learning
## Project Overview
This project predicts the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties using Deep Learning models built in TensorFlow/Keras.
The goal is to compare different modelling approaches — Sequential API, Functional API, and Keras Tuner — and evaluate their performance on the Wine Quality dataset.

## Objectives
- Apply deep learning to structured/tabular data.
- Explore multiple modelling paradigms in Keras:
- Sequential API (simple feed‑forward networks).
- Functional API (flexible architectures).
- Keras Tuner (automated hyperparameter optimisation).
- Evaluate models using accuracy, loss curves, and other metrics.
- Provide reproducible code and clear documentation for learning and deployment.

## Approaches
1. Sequential API
- Simple feed‑forward architecture.
- Easy to implement, good baseline.
2. Functional API
- Flexible design for complex architectures.
- Allows branching, skip connections, and custom layers.
3. Keras Tuner
- Automated hyperparameter search.
- Optimises layer sizes, learning rates, and activation functions.

## Key Learnings
- Difference between Sequential vs Functional API in Keras.
- Importance of hyperparameter tuning for improving DL models.
- How DL can be applied effectively to structured/tabular data.

## Next Steps
- Deploy model via FastAPI/Flask on Azure.
- Extend the project to NLP or computer vision datasets.
- Compare DL performance with classical ML baselines (Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
